<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This SPA was integrated with a pre-built API that allows a user to sign up, sign in, and sign out. It also allows for creating a new game, and storing game details and user data on the server. The game logic, user authentication form, and styling are handled locally on the client through my own code. Design was kept simple as an ode to the simplicity of the tic-tac-toe game itself. 

With a simplistic design in mind, I developed this [wireframe](images/tictactoe.jpeg) before starting on development.

* As a user, I want to sign out.
* As a user, I want to start a new game.
* As a user, I want to click on a box and have it populate with "X" or "O".
